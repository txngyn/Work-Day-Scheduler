# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## User Story 

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Execution Plan

1. Create Elements and CSS styling in HTML for hours of the working day 9am-5pm

* Bootstrap elements and CSS classes provided in style.css Appended to the HTML for each hour

* Current Date is displayed at the top of the scheduler with jQuery using Moment.js API

2. Functionality with JavaScript, jQuery and API

* When the user enters text into the input area they can save their task to local storage by clicking the save button associated with that hour's row and it will still be there after refreshing the page

* The hours text area is colour coordinated to represent the past, present and future time by the hour using Moment.js API

* When the user clicks the clear all button, the text is cleared from the input fields and also the local storage.
